package _91_Number_of_1_Bits

// Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits
// it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
//
//Note:
//
//    Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.
//    In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type.
//    It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same,
//    whether it is signed or unsigned.
//
//    In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation.
//    Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.
